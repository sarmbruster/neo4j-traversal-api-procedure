# neo4j-traversal-api-procedure

A code example to show usage of Neo4j Traversal API inside a stored procedure.

## installation

To build and install type:

----
./gradlew build
cp ./build/libs/neo4j-traversal-api-procedure-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <MY_NEO4J_DIR>/plugins
----

## usage

This library provides the following stored procedures for Cypher:

### `traversals.maxWeightedProductPaths`

Based on a given start node, all outgoing relationships are traversed up to provided maximum depth. Along the path all `weight` properties of the relationships are multiplied. If they are above a given threshold they are part of the result. For each of the target nodes, the maximum weight is returned.

Example:

----
MATCH (s:Entity{id:1}) // find start node
CALL traversals.maxWeightedProductPaths(s, 7, 0.3) YIELD max, path
RETURN max,path
----
